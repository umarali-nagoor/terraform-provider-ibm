# ibm\_lb_service

Provides a resource for local load balancer services. This allows local load balancer services to be created, updated, and deleted.

For additional details, see the [IBM Cloud Classic Infrastructure (SoftLayer) API docs](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_Network_Application_Delivery_Controller_LoadBalancer_Service).

## Example Usage

In the following example, you can create a local load balancer service:

```hcl
resource "ibm_lb_service" "test_lb_local_service" {
    port = 80
    enabled = true
    service_group_id = ibm_lb_service_group.test_service_group.service_group_id
    weight = 1
    health_check_type = "DNS"
    ip_address_id = ibm_compute_vm_instance.test_server.ip_address_id
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `service_group_id` - (Required, Forces new resource, integer) The ID of the local load balancer service group.
