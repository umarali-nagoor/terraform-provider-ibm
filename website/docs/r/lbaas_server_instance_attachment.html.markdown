# ibm\_lbaas\_server\_instance\_attachment

Provides a resource for attaching the server instance to IBM cloud load balancer. This allows to attach, detach and update server instances as loadbalancer members to IBM cloud load balancer. A `depends_on` statement is required for the associated load balancer to ensure that attach and detach only occur after and before load balancer creation and deletion. If the `depends_on` is ommited intemitent attach failures will occur on creation and load balancer deletion will fail. Typically when apply or destroy is rerun the operation will be successful. 


 
## Example Usage

```hcl

resource "ibm_compute_vm_instance" "vm_instances" {
  count = "2"
  
}

resource "ibm_lbaas" "lbaas" {
  name        = "terraformLB"
  description = "delete this"
  subnets     = [1511875]

  protocols {
    frontend_protocol     = "HTTPS"
    frontend_port         = 443
    backend_protocol      = "HTTP"
    backend_port          = 80
    load_balancing_method = "round_robin"
    tls_certificate_id    = 11670
  }
  protocols {
    frontend_protocol     = "HTTP"
    frontend_port         = 80
    backend_protocol      = "HTTP"
    backend_port          = 80
    load_balancing_method = "round_robin"
  }
}

resource "ibm_lbaas_server_instance_attachment" "lbaas_member" {
  count = 2
  private_ip_address = element(
    ibm_compute_vm_instance.vm_instances.*.ipv4_address_private,
    count.index,
  )
  weight     = 40
  lbaas_id   = ibm_lbaas.lbaas.id
  depends_on = [ibm_lbaas.lbaas]
}

```
