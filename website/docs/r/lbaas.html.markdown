  Manages IBM Load balancer as a service.

# ibm\_lbaas

Provides a resource for a load balancer as a service. This allows a load balancer as a service to be created, updated, and deleted. Currently, only one subnet is supported.

Cloud load balancer creation takes 5 to 10 minutes. Destroy can take up to 30 minutes. Cloud Load Balancer does not support customisation of acceptable response codes. Only the range 2xx is considered healthy. Redirects in the range 3xx are considered unhealthy. 
 
## Example Usage

```hcl

resource "ibm_lbaas" "lbaas" {
  name        = "terraformLB"
  description = "delete this"
  subnets     = [1511875]

  protocols {
    frontend_protocol     = "HTTPS"
    frontend_port         = 443
    backend_protocol      = "HTTP"
    backend_port          = 80
    load_balancing_method = "round_robin"
    tls_certificate_id    = 11670
  }
  protocols {
    frontend_protocol     = "HTTP"
    frontend_port         = 80
    backend_protocol      = "HTTP"
    backend_port          = 80
    load_balancing_method = "round_robin"
  }
}




```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required, Forces new resource, string) The load balancer's name.
* `description` - (Optional, string) A description of the load balancer.
* `type` - (Optional, Forces new resource, string) Specify whether this load balancer is a public or internal facing load balancer. Accepted values are `PUBLIC` or `PRIVATE`. 
The default is 'PUBLIC'.
* `subnets` - (Required, Forces new resource, array) The subnet where the load balancer will be provisioned. Only one subnet is supported.
* `protocols` - (Optional, array) A nested block describing the protocols assigned to load balancer. Nested `protocols` blocks have the following structure:
  * `frontend_protocol` - (Required, string) The frontend protocol. Accepted values are 'TCP', 'HTTP', and 'HTTPS'.
  * `frontend_port` - (Required, integer) The frontend protocol port number. The port number must be in the range of 1 - 65535.
  * `backend_protocol` - (Required, string) The backend protocol. Accepted values are 'TCP', 'HTTP', and 'HTTPS'.
  * `backend_port` - (Required, integer) The backend protocol port number. The port number must be in the range of 1 - 65535.
  * `load_balancing_method` - (Optional, string) The load balancing algorithm. Accepted values are 'round_robin', 'weighted_round_robin', and 'least_connection'. The default is 'round_robin'.
  * `session_stickiness` - (Optional, string) The SOURCE_IP for session stickiness.
  * `max_conn` - (Optional, integer) The maximum number of connections the listener can accept. The number must be 1 - 64000.
  * `tls_certificate_id` - (Optional, integer) The ID of the SSL/TLS certificate being used for a protocol. This ID should be specified when `frontend protocol` has a value of `HTTPS`.
* `ssl_ciphers` - (Optional, list) The comma seperated list of SSL Ciphers. You can find list of supported cipheres [ssl_offload](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/infrastructure/loadbalancer-service?topic=loadbalancer-service-ssl-offload-with-ibm-cloud-load-balancer).
* `use_system_public_ip_pool` - (Optional, bool) Applicable for public load balancer only. It specifies whether the public IP addresses are allocated from system public IP pool or public subnet from the account ordering the load balancer. If not specified for public load balancer public IP addresses are allocated from system public IP pool.
* `wait_time_minutes` - (Optional, integer) The duration, expressed in minutes, to wait for the lbaas instance to become available before declaring it as created. It is also the same amount of time waited for deletion to finish. The default value is `90`.

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The unique identifier of the created policy.
* `datacenter` - The datacenter where the load balancer is provisioned. This is based on the subnet chosen while creating load-balancer.
* `status` - Specifies the operation status of the load balancer as `ONLINE` or `OFFLINE`.
* `vip` - The virtual IP address of the load balancer.
* `protocol_id` - The UUID of a load balancer protocol.
* `health_monitors` - A nested block describing the health_monitors assigned to the load balancer. Nested `health_monitors` blocks have the following structure:
  * `protocol` - Backends protocol
  * `port` - Backends port
  * `interval` - Interval in seconds to perform 
  * `max_retries` - Maximum retries
  * `timeout` - Health check methods timeout in 
  * `url_path` - If monitor is "HTTP", this specifies URL path
  * `monitor_id` - Health Monitor UUID
