# ibm\_firewall

Provides a firewall in IBM. One firewall protects one public VLAN and provides in-bound network packet filtering.

You can order or find firewalls in the IBM Cloud infrastructure customer portal by navigating to **Network > IP Management > VLANs** and clicking the **Gateway/Firewall** column.

For more information about how to configure a firewall, see the [docs](https://knowledgelayer.softlayer.com/procedure/configure-hardware-firewall-dedicated).

## Example Usage

resource "ibm_firewall" "testfw" {
  firewall_type  = "HARDWARE_FIREWALL_DEDICATED"
  ha_enabled     = false
  public_vlan_id = 12345678
  tags = [
    "collectd",
    "mesos-master",
  ]
}

```
