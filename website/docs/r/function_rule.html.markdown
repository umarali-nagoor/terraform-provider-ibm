# ibm\_function_rule

Create, update, or delete [IBM Cloud Functions triggers](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/openwhisk/openwhisk_triggers_rules.html#openwhisk_triggers). Events from external and internal event sources are channeled through a trigger, and rules allow your actions to react to these events. To set triggers, use the `function_trigger` resource.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "ibm_function_action" "action" {
  name = "hello"

  exec {
    kind = "nodejs:6"
    code = file("test-fixtures/hellonode.js")
  }
}

resource "ibm_function_trigger" "trigger" {
  name = "alarmtrigger"

  feed {
    name = "/whisk.system/alarms/alarm"

    parameters = <<EOF
                                        [
                                                {
                                                        "key":"cron",
                                                        "value":"0 */2 * * *"
                                                }
                                        ]

EOF

  }
}

resource "ibm_function_rule" "rule" {
  name         = "alarmrule"
  trigger_name = ibm_function_trigger.trigger.name
  action_name  = ibm_function_action.action.name
}

```
