# ibm\_iam_user_policy

Provides a resource for IAM User Policy. This allows user policy to be created, updated and deleted. To assign a policy to one user, the user must exist in the account to which you assign the policy. 

## Example Usage

### User Policy for All Identity and Access enabled services 

```hcl
resource "ibm_iam_user_policy" "policy" {
  ibm_id = "test@in.ibm.com"
  roles  = ["Viewer"]
}

```

### User Policy using service with region

```hcl
resource "ibm_iam_user_policy" "policy" {
  ibm_id = "test@in.ibm.com"
  roles  = ["Viewer"]

  resources {
    service = "kms"
  }
}

```
### User Policy using resource instance 

```hcl
resource "ibm_resource_instance" "instance" {
  name     = "test"
  service  = "kms"
  plan     = "tiered-pricing"
  location = "us-south"
}

resource "ibm_iam_user_policy" "policy" {
  ibm_id = "test@in.ibm.com"
  roles  = ["Manager", "Viewer", "Administrator"]

  resources {
    service              = "kms"
    resource_instance_id = element(split(":", ibm_resource_instance.instance.id), 7)
  }
}

```

### User Policy using resource group 

```hcl
data "ibm_resource_group" "group" {
  name = "default"
}

resource "ibm_iam_user_policy" "policy" {
  ibm_id = "test@in.ibm.com"
  roles  = ["Viewer"]

  resources {
    service           = "containers-kubernetes"
    resource_group_id = data.ibm_resource_group.group.id
  }
}

```

### User Policy using resource and resource type 

```hcl
data "ibm_resource_group" "group" {
  name = "default"
}

resource "ibm_iam_user_policy" "policy" {
  ibm_id = "test@in.ibm.com"
  roles  = ["Administrator"]

  resources {
    resource_type = "resource-group"
    resource      = data.ibm_resource_group.group.id
  }
}

```

### User Policy using attributes 

```hcl
data "ibm_resource_group" "group" {
  name = "default"
}

resource "ibm_iam_user_policy" "policy" {
  ibm_id = "test@in.ibm.com"
  roles  = ["Administrator"]

  resources {
    service = "is"

    attributes = {
      "vpcId" = "*"
    }
  }
}

```

  * `resource_instance_id` - (Optional, string) ID of resource instance of the policy definition.
  * `region` - (Optional, string) Region of the policy definition.
  * `resource_type` - (Optional, string) Resource type of the policy definition.
  * `resource` - (Optional, string) Resource of the policy definition.
  * `resource_group_id` - (Optional, string) The ID of the resource group. You can retrieve the value from data source `ibm_resource_group`. 
  * `attributes` - (Optional, map) Set resource attributes in the form of `'name=value,name=value...`.
 **NOTE**: Conflicts with `account_management`.
* `account_management` - (Optional, bool) Gives access to all account management services if set to `true`. Default value `false`. 
 **NOTE**: Conflicts with `resources`.
