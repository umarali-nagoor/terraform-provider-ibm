# ibm\_storage_file

ibm_storage_file resource provides a file storage resource. This allows NFS-based Endurance and Performance [file storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/infrastructure/FileStorage/index.html) to be created, updated, and deleted.

File storage is mounted using the NFS protocol. For example, a file storage resource with the `hostname` argument set to `nfsdal0501a.service.softlayer.com` and the `volumename` argument set to ` IBM01SV278685_7` has the mount point `nfsdal0501a.service.softlayer.com:\IBM01SV278685_7`.

See [Mounting File Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/infrastructure/FileStorage/accessing-file-storage-linux.html) for NFS configuration.

## Example Usage

In the following example, you can create 20G of Endurance file storage with a 10G snapshot capacity and 0.25 IOPS/GB.

```hcl
resource "ibm_storage_file" "fs_endurance" {
  type       = "Endurance"
  datacenter = "dal06"
  capacity   = 20
  iops       = 0.25

  # Optional fields
  allowed_virtual_guest_ids = ["28961689"]
  allowed_subnets           = ["10.146.139.64/26"]
  allowed_ip_addresses      = ["10.146.139.84"]
  snapshot_capacity         = 10
  hourly_billing            = true

  # Optional fields for snapshot
  snapshot_schedule {
    schedule_type   = "WEEKLY"
    retention_count = 20
    minute          = 2
    hour            = 13
    day_of_week     = "SUNDAY"
    enable          = true
  }
  snapshot_schedule {
    schedule_type   = "HOURLY"
    retention_count = 20
    minute          = 2
    enable          = true
  }

}


```

In the following example, you can create 20G of Performance file storage with 100 IOPS.

```hcl
resource "ibm_storage_file" "fs_performance" {
  type       = "Performance"
  datacenter = "dal06"
  capacity   = 20
  iops       = 100

  # Optional fields
  allowed_virtual_guest_ids = ["28961689"]
  allowed_subnets           = ["10.146.139.64/26"]
  allowed_ip_addresses      = ["10.146.139.84"]
  hourly_billing            = true
}
```

## Timeouts

ibm_storage_file provides the following [Timeouts](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#timeouts) configuration options:

* `create` - (Default 45 minutes) Used for creating Instance.
* `delete` - (Default 45 minutes) Used for deleting Instance.
* `update` - (Default 45 minutes) Used for updating Instance.

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `type` - (Required, Forces new resource, string) The type of the storage. Accepted values are `Endurance` and `Performance`
* `datacenter` - (Required, Forces new resource, string) The data center where you want to provision the file storage instance.
* `capacity` - (Required, integer) The amount of storage capacity you want to allocate, expressed in gigabytes.
* `iops` - (Required, float) The IOPS value for the storage instance. You can find available values for Endurance storage in the [IBM docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/infrastructure/FileStorage/index.html#provisioning-with-endurance-tiers).
* `snapshot_capacity` - (Optional, Forces new resource, integer) The amount of snapshot capacity you want to allocate, expressed in gigabytes.
* `allowed_virtual_guest_ids` - (Optional, array of integers) The virtual guests that you want to give access to this instance. Virtual guests must be in the same data center as the block storage. You can also use this field to import the list of virtual guests that have access to this storage from the `block_storage_ids` argument in the `ibm_compute_vm_instance` resource.
* `allowed_hardware_ids` - (Optional, array of integers) The bare metal servers that you want to give access to this instance. Bare metal servers must be in the same data center as the block storage. You can also use this field to import the list of bare metal servers that have access to this storage from the `block_storage_ids` argument in the `ibm_compute_bare_metal` resource.
* `allowed_subnets` - (Optional, array of integers) The subnets that you want to give access to this instance. Subnets must be in the same data center as the block storage.
* `allowed_ip_addresses` - (Optional, array of string) The IP addresses that you want to allow. IP addresses must be in the same data center as the block storage. 
* `snapshot_schedule` - (Optional, array) Applies only to Endurance storage. Specifies the parameters required for a snapshot schedule.
    * `schedule_type` - (String) The snapshot schedule type. Accepted values are `HOURLY`, `WEEKLY`, and `DAILY`.
    * `retention_count` - (Integer) The retention count for a snapshot schedule. Required for all types of `schedule_type`.
    * `minute` - (Integer) The minute for a snapshot schedule. Required for all types of `schedule_type`.
    * `hour` - (Integer) The hour for a snapshot schedule. Required if `schedule_type` is set to `DAILY` or `WEEKLY`.
    * `day_of_week` - (String) The day of the week for a snapshot schedule. Required if the `schedule_type` is set to `WEEKLY`.
    * `enable` - (Boolean) Whether to disable an existing snapshot schedule.

* `notes` - (Optional, string) Descriptive text to associate with the file storage.  

* `tags` - (Optional, array of strings) Tags associated with the file storage instance.  
  **NOTE**: `Tags` are managed locally and not stored on the IBM Cloud service endpoint at this moment.  
* `hourly_billing` - (Optional, Forces new resource, Boolean) Set true to enable hourly billing. Default is false.  
**NOTE**: `Hourly billing` is only available in updated datacenters with improved capabilities.Plesae refer the [link](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/infrastructure/FileStorage/new-ibm-block-and-file-storage-location-and-features.html#new-locations-and-features-of-file-storage) to get the updated list of datacenter.
