  name = "is-example-acl"
  rules {
    name        = "outbound"
    action      = "allow"
    source      = "0.0.0.0/0"
    destination = "0.0.0.0/0"
    direction   = "outbound"
    icmp {
      code = 1
      type = 1
    }
  }
  rules {
    name        = "inbound"
    action      = "allow"
    source      = "0.0.0.0/0"
    destination = "0.0.0.0/0"
    direction   = "inbound"
    icmp {
      code = 1
      type = 1
    }
  }
}
```
