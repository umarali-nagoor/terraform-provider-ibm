# ibm\_network_gateway

Provides a resource for an IBM Cloud network gateway appliance. This resource allows a network gateway to be created, updated, and deleted.  

A network gateway can be created in standalone mode and HA mode with both members, with either the same or different configurations.

For additional details, see the [IBM Cloud Classic Infrastructure (SoftLayer) API docs](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Network_Gateway).

For more information about getting started, see the [IBM Virtual Router Appliance docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/infrastructure/virtual-router-appliance/getting-started.html#getting-started).

## Example Usage

### Standalone configuration

```hcl
resource "ibm_network_gateway" "gateway" {
  name = "my-gateway"

  members {
    hostname             = "host-name"
    domain               = "ibm.com"
    datacenter           = "ams01"
    network_speed        = 100
    private_network_only = false
    tcp_monitoring       = true
    process_key_name     = "INTEL_SINGLE_XEON_1270_3_50"
    os_key_name          = "OS_VYATTA_5600_5_X_UP_TO_1GBPS_SUBSCRIPTION_EDITION_64_BIT"
