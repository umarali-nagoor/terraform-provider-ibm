  Manages IBM DNS resource records.

# ibm\_dns_record

Provides a single-resource record entry in `ibm_dns_domain`. Each resource record contains a `host` and a `data` property to define the name and target data of a resource.

The IBM Cloud Classic Infrastructure (SoftLayer) object  [SoftLayer_Dns_Domain_ResourceRecord](https://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/datatypes/SoftLayer_Dns_Domain_ResourceRecord) is used for most CRUD operations. The IBM Cloud Classic Infrastructure (SoftLayer) object [SoftLayer_Dns_Domain_ResourceRecord_SrvType](https://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Dns_Domain_ResourceRecord_SrvType) is used for SRV record types.

The SOA and NS records are automatically created by IBM Cloud Classic Infrastructure (SoftLayer) when the domain is created, you don't need to create those manually.

## Example Usage

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `data` - (Required, string) The IP address or a hostname of a domain's resource record. Fully qualified host and domain name data must end with the `.` character.
* `domain_id` - (Required, Forces new resource, integer) The ID for the domain associated with the resource record.
* `expire` - (Optional, integer) The duration, expressed in seconds, that a secondary name server (or servers) holds a zone before it is no longer considered authoritative.
* `host` - (Required, string) The host defined by a resource record. The `@` symbol denotes a wildcard.
* `minimum_ttl` - (Optional, integer) The duration, expressed in seconds, that a domain's resource records are valid. This is also known as a minimum time to live (TTL), and can be overridden by an individual resource record's TTL.
* `mx_priority` - (Optional, integer) The priority of the mail exchanger that delivers mail for a domain. This is useful in cases where a domain has more than one mail exchanger. A lower number denotes a higher priority, and mail will attempt to deliver through the highest priority exchanger before moving to lower priority exchangers. The default value is `0`.
* `refresh` - (Optional, integer) The duration, expressed in seconds, that a secondary name server waits to check the domain's primary name server for a new copy of a DNS zone. If a zone file has changed, the secondary DNS server updates its copy of the zone to match the primary DNS server's zone.
* `responsible_person` - (Required, string) The email address of the person responsible for a domain. Replace the `@` symbol in the address with a `.`. For example: root@example.org would be expressed as `root.example.org.`.
* `retry` - (Optional, integer) The duration, expressed in seconds, that the domain's primary name server (or servers) waits before attempting to refresh the domain's zone with the secondary name server. A failed attempt to refresh by a secondary name server triggers the retry action.
* `ttl` - (Required, integer) The time to live (TTL) duration, expressed in seconds, of a resource record. A name server uses TTL to determine how long to cache a resource record. An SOA record's TTL value defines the domain's overall TTL.
* `type` - (Required, Forces new resource, string) The type of domain resource record. Accepted values are as follows:
    * `a` for address records
    * `aaaa` for address records
    * `cname` for canonical name records
    * `mx` for mail exchanger records
    * `ptr` for pointer records in reverse domains
    * `spf` for sender policy framework records
    * `srv` for service records
* `txt` - (Optional, string) Used for text records.
* `service` - (`SRV` records only, required, string) The symbolic name of the desired service.
* `protocol` - (`SRV` records only, required, string) The protocol of the desired service. This is usually TCP or UDP.
* `port` - (`SRV` records only, required, integer) The TCP or UDP port on which the service will be found.
* `priority` - (`SRV` records only, required, integer) The priority of the target host. The lowest numerical value is given the highest priority. The default value is `0`.
* `weight` - (`SRV` records only, required, integer) A relative weight for records that have the same priority. The default value is `0`.
* `tags` - (Optional, array of strings) Tags associated with the DNS domain record instance.  
  **NOTE**: `Tags` are managed locally and not stored on the IBM Cloud service endpoint at this moment.

## Attribute Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The internal identifier of the domain resource record.
