# ibm\_app_route

Provides a route resource. This allows routes to be created, updated, and deleted.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_space" "spacedata" {
  space = "space"
  org   = "someexample.com"
}

data "ibm_app_domain_shared" "domain" {
  name = "mybluemix.net"
}

resource "ibm_app_route" "route" {
  domain_guid = data.ibm_app_domain_shared.domain.id
  space_guid  = data.ibm_space.spacedata.id
  host        = "somehost172"
  path        = "/app"
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `space_guid` - (Required, string) The GUID of the space where you want to create the route. You can retrieve the value from data source `ibm_space` or by running the `ibmcloud iam space <space_name> --guid` command in the [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started).
* `host` - (Optional, string) The host portion of the route. Host is required for shared-domains.

* `tags` - (Optional, array of strings) Tags associated with the route instance.  
    **NOTE**: `Tags` are managed locally and not stored on the IBM Cloud service endpoint at this moment.
