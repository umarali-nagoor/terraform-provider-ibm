# ibm\_network_gateway_vlan_association

Provide a resource to associate a VLAN with a network gateway. The VLANs can be disassociated or updated later to be bypassed or routed.

For additional details, see the [IBM Cloud Classic Infrastructure (SoftLayer) API docs](http://sldn.softlayer.com/reference/services/SoftLayer_Network_Gateway_Vlan).

For more information about getting started, see the [IBM Virtual Router Appliance docs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/infrastructure/virtual-router-appliance/getting-started.html#getting-started).

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "ibm_network_gateway" "gateway" {
  name = "gateway"

  members {
    hostname             = "my-virtual-router"
    domain               = "terraformuat1.ibm.com"
    datacenter           = "ams01"
    network_speed        = 100
    private_network_only = false
    tcp_monitoring       = true
    process_key_name     = "INTEL_SINGLE_XEON_1270_3_40_2"
    os_key_name          = "OS_VYATTA_5600_5_X_UP_TO_1GBPS_SUBSCRIPTION_EDITION_64_BIT"
    redundant_network    = false
    disk_key_names       = ["HARD_DRIVE_2_00TB_SATA_II"]
    public_bandwidth     = 20000
    memory               = 4
    ipv6_enabled         = true
  }
}

resource "ibm_network_gateway_vlan_association" "gateway_vlan_association" {
  gateway_id      = ibm_network_gateway.gateway.id
  network_vlan_id = 645086
}


```
