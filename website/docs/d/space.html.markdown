# ibm\_space

Import the details of an existing IBM Cloud space as a read-only data source. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration by using interpolation syntax.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_space" "spaceData" {
  space = "prod"
  org   = "someexample.com"
}
```

The following example shows how you can use the data source to reference the space ID in the `ibm_service_instance` resource.

```hcl
resource "ibm_service_instance" "service_instance" {
  name       = "test"
  space_guid = data.ibm_space.spaceData.id
  service    = "speech_to_text"
  plan       = "lite"
  tags       = ["cluster-service", "cluster-bind"]
}
```
