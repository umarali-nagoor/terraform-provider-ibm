# ibm\_app_route

Import the details of an existing IBM Cloud route as a read-only data source. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration by using interpolation syntax.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_app_route" "route" {
  domain_guid = data.ibm_app_domain_shared.domain.id
  space_guid  = data.ibm_space.spacedata.id
  host        = "somehost"
  path        = "/app"
}
```

## Argument Reference

* `space_guid` - (Required, string) The GUID of the space where you want to create the route. You can retrieve the value from the `ibm_space` data source or by running the `ibmcloud iam space <space-name> --guid` command in the [IBM Cloud CLI](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/cli?topic=cloud-cli-getting-started).
* `host` - (Optional, string) The host portion of the route. Required for shared domains.
* `port` - (Optional, integer) The port of the route. Supported for domains of TCP router groups only.
