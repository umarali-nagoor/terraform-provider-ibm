  Get information about an IBM Compute SSH key.

# ibm\_compute_ssh_key

Import the details of an existing SSH key as a read-only data source. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration by using interpolation syntax.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_compute_ssh_key" "public_key" {
    label = "Terraform Public Key"
}
```

The following example shows how you can use this data source to reference the SSH key IDs in the `ibm_compute_vm_instance` resource because the numeric IDs are often unknown.

```hcl
resource "ibm_compute_vm_instance" "vm1" {
  # TF-UPGRADE-TODO: In Terraform v0.10 and earlier, it was sometimes necessary to
  # force an interpolation expression to be interpreted as a list by wrapping it
  # in an extra set of list brackets. That form was supported for compatibility in
  # v0.11, but is no longer supported in Terraform v0.12.
  #
  # If the expression in the following list itself returns a list, remove the
  # brackets to avoid interpretation as a list of lists. If the expression
  # returns a single list item then leave it as-is and remove this TODO comment.
  ssh_key_ids = [data.ibm_compute_ssh_key.public_key.id]
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `label` - (Required, string) The label of the SSH key, as it was defined in IBM Cloud Classic Infrastructure (SoftLayer).
* `most_recent` - (Optional, boolean) If more than one SSH key matches the label, you can set this argument to `true` to import only the most recent key.
  **NOTE**: The search must return only one match. More or less than one match causes Terraform to fail. Ensure that your label is specific enough to return a single SSH key only, or use the `most_recent` argument.

## Attribute Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `id` - The unique identifier of the SSH key.  
* `fingerprint` - The sequence of bytes to authenticate or look up a longer SSH key.
* `public_key` - The public key contents.
* `notes` - The notes that are stored with the SSH key.
