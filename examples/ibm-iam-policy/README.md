# IBM IAM User Policy example

This example shows how to create and assign a IAM User policy to an user in account.

A policy assigns a user a role or roles to a set of resources by using a combination of attributes to define the applicable set of resources. When you assign a policy to a user, you first specify the service. Then, you can select a role, or roles, to assign. Additional configuration options might be available, depending on the service you select.

 In this example a cluster service is created and used to specify a service.
